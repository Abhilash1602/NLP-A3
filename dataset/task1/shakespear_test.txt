BRAKENBURY : I beseech your grace to pardon me , and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke .
MENENIUS : The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night .
I do beseech your majesty , To have some conference with your grace alone .
This and much more , much more than twice all this , Condemns you to the death .
Lord Marshal : In God 's name and the king 's , say who thou art And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms , Against what man thou comest , and what thy quarrel : Speak truly , on thy knighthood and thy oath ; As so defend thee heaven and thy valour !
Both : To , to , to -- CLARENCE : To murder me ?
He wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in .
Still , 't is strange He thus should steal upon us .
COMINIUS : Ay ; and you 'll look pale Before you find it other .
ANGELO : Say you so ?
Father : These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet ; My heart , sweet boy , shall be thy sepulchre , For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go ; My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell ; And so obsequious will thy father be , Even for the loss of thee , having no more , As Priam was for all his valiant sons .
Yet welcome , warriors : We call a nettle but a nettle and The faults of fools but folly .
God save your good worships !
MENENIUS : I am , as thy general is .
Mean time let this defend my loyalty , By all my hopes , most falsely doth he lie .
NORTHUMBERLAND : My liege , old Gaunt commends him to your majesty .
Officer : You here shall swear upon this sword of justice , That you , Cleomenes and Dion , have Been both at Delphos , and from thence have brought The seal'd-up oracle , by the hand deliver 'd Of great Apollo 's priest ; and that , since then , You have not dared to break the holy seal Nor read the secrets i n't .
O that you could !
Second Gentleman : To three thousand dolours a year .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break .
Sir , you yourself Have said and writ so , but your writing now Is colder than that theme , 'She had not been , Nor was not to be equall 'd ; ' -- thus your verse Flow 'd with her beauty once : 't is shrewdly ebb 'd , To say you have seen a better .
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade To shepherds looking on their silly sheep , Than doth a rich embroider 'd canopy To kings that fear their subjects ' treachery ?
KING RICHARD II : Rage must be withstood : Give me his gage : lions make leopards tame .
KING EDWARD IV : Bishop , farewell : shield thee from Warwick 's frown ; And pray that I may repossess the crown .
Servant : One Isabel , a sister , desires access to you .
Speak 'pardon ' as 't is current in our land ; The chopping French we do not understand .
MARCIUS : Here : what 's the matter ?
GLOUCESTER : A gentle cousin , were it light enough .
O Lancaster , I fear thy overthrow More than my body 's parting with my soul !
JULIET : O God !
And if I were thy nurse , thy tongue to teach , 'Pardon ' should be the first word of thy speech .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Come , come , my boy ; we will to sanctuary .
Call up Lord Stanley , bid him bring his power : I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain , And thus my battle shall be ordered : My foreward shall be drawn out all in length , Consisting equally of horse and foot ; Our archers shall be placed in the midst John Duke of Norfolk , Thomas Earl of Surrey , Shall have the leading of this foot and horse .
O , the blood is spilt O my dear kinsman !
SICINIUS : He loved his mother dearly .
MENENIUS : You guard like men ; 't is well : but , by your leave , I am an officer of state , and come To speak with Coriolanus .
Tybalt , liest thou there in thy bloody sheet ?
But , out , affection !
PARIS : Come you to make confession to this father ?
O friar , the damned use that word in hell ; Howlings attend it : how hast thou the heart , Being a divine , a ghostly confessor , A sin-absolver , and my friend profess 'd , To mangle me with that word 'banished ' ?
NORTHUMBERLAND : Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come .
SICINIUS : Thus to have said , As you were fore-advised , had touch 'd his spirit And tried his inclination ; from him pluck 'd Either his gracious promise , which you might , As cause had call 'd you up , have held him to Or else it would have gall 'd his surly nature , Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught ; so putting him to rage , You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler And pass 'd him unelected .
Why , trow'st thou , Warwick , That Clarence is so harsh , so blunt , unnatural , To bend the fatal instruments of war Against his brother and his lawful king ?
FLORIZEL : Dispatch , I prithee .
GLOUCESTER : I can not tell : the world is grown so bad , That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch : Since every Jack became a gentleman There 's many a gentle person made a Jack .
ROMEO : Wilt thou provoke me ?
Thou hast a grim appearance , and thy face Bears a command i n't ; though thy tackle 's torn .
AUTOLYCUS : I will prove so , sir , to my power .
This night I hold an old accustom 'd feast , Whereto I have invited many a guest , Such as I love ; and you , among the store , One more , most welcome , makes my number more .
What , is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence ?
Get you gone , and let me hear no more of you .
Either be patient , and entreat me fair , Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations .
MENENIUS : That 's worthily As any ear can hear .
CORIOLANUS : Ha !
JOHN OF GAUNT : Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure .
What sadness lengthens Romeo 's hours ?
Worthy Marcius , Had we no quarrel else to Rome , but that Thou art thence banish 'd , we would muster all From twelve to seventy , and pouring war Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome , Like a bold flood o'er-bear .
DUKE OF YORK : Be York the next that must be bankrupt so !
You have won a happy victory to Rome ; But , for your son , -- believe it , O , believe it , Most dangerously you have with him prevail 'd , If not most mortal to him .
Ah , dear Juliet , Why art thou yet so fair ?
DUKE OF YORK : Speak it in French , king ; say , 'pardonne moi . '
KING EDWARD IV : When we grow stronger , then we 'll make our claim : Till then , 't is wisdom to conceal our meaning .
the second cock hath crow 'd , The curfew-bell hath rung , 't is three o'clock : Look to the baked meats , good Angelica : Spare not for the cost .
HASTINGS : What is't o'clock ?
O life !
what , are you mad ?
Is ink and paper ready ?
I see your brows are full of discontent , Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears : Come home with me to supper ; and I 'll lay A plot shall show us all a merry day .
Good man , the wounds that he does bear for Rome !
BUCKINGHAM : Lord mayor , the reason we have sent -- GLOUCESTER : Look back , defend thee , here are enemies .
CAMILLO : Yea , say you so ?
You have misled a prince , a royal king , A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments , By you unhappied and disfigured clean : You have in manner with your sinful hours Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him , Broke the possession of a royal bed And stain 'd the beauty of a fair queen 's cheeks With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs .
HASTINGS : Good morrow , Catesby ; you are early stirring What news , what news , in this our tottering state ?
GLOUCESTER : The queen is valued thirty thousand strong , And Somerset , with Oxford fled to her : If she have time to breathe be well assured Her faction will be full as strong as ours .
O no !
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home : But dust was thrown upon his sacred head : Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off , His face still combating with tears and smiles , The badges of his grief and patience , That had not God , for some strong purpose , steel 'd The hearts of men , they must perforce have melted And barbarism itself have pitied him .
Come , Camillo , And take her by the hand , whose worth and honesty Is richly noted and here justified By us , a pair of kings .
For you , my noble Lord of Lancaster , The honourable father to my foe Once did I lay an ambush for your life , A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul But ere I last received the sacrament I did confess it , and exactly begg 'd Your grace 's pardon , and I hope I had it .
Scurvy knave !
Second Patrician : I would they were abed !
Cousin Aumerle , How far brought you high Hereford on his way ?
CORIOLANUS : Know , good mother , I had rather be their servant in my way , Than sway with them in theirs .
ROMEO : At the hour of nine .
RUTLAND : But 't was ere I was born .
In winter 's tedious nights sit by the fire With good old folks and let them tell thee tales Of woeful ages long ago betid ; And ere thou bid good night , to quit their griefs , Tell thou the lamentable tale of me And send the hearers weeping to their beds : For why , the senseless brands will sympathize The heavy accent of thy moving tongue And in compassion weep the fire out ; And some will mourn in ashes , some coal-black , For the deposing of a rightful king .
SICINIUS : Peace !
It is now dead midnight .
FRANCISCA : Are not these large enough ?
Nurse : JULIET : I come , anon.
KING RICHARD III : 'Zounds !
Behold , my lords , Although the print be little , the whole matter And copy of the father , eye , nose , lip , The trick of 's frown , his forehead , nay , the valley , The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek , His smiles , The very mould and frame of hand , nail , finger : And thou , good goddess Nature , which hast made it So like to him that got it , if thou hast The ordering of the mind too , 'mongst all colours No yellow i n't , lest she suspect , as he does , Her children not her husband 's !
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais ; Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas ; The duke is made protector of the realm ; And yet shalt thou be safe ?
for we want thy help .
First Murderer : Take that , and that : if all this will not do , I 'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within .
No deeper wrinkles yet ?
Both : Ay , ay .
To-day , to-day , unhappy day , too late , O'erthrows thy joys , friends , fortune and thy state : For all the Welshmen , hearing thou wert dead .
LUCIO : A French crown more .
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court ?
DUKE OF YORK : To do that office of thine own good will Which tired majesty did make thee offer , The resignation of thy state and crown To Henry Bolingbroke .
ANGELO : I show it most of all when I show justice ; For then I pity those I do not know , Which a dismiss 'd offence would after gall ; And do him right that , answering one foul wrong , Lives not to act another .
LADY GREY : Be pitiful , dread lord , and grant it then .
should it then be thus ?
EDWARD : I hear their drums : let 's set our men in order , And issue forth and bid them battle straight .
where have you been gadding ?
THOMAS MOWBRAY : O , let my sovereign turn away his face And bid his ears a little while be deaf , Till I have told this slander of his blood , How God and good men hate so foul a liar .
Come , shall we to this gear ?
I do believe Hermione hath suffer 'd death , and that Apollo would , this being indeed the issue Of King Polixenes , it should here be laid , Either for life or death , upon the earth Of its right father .
Either thou art most ignorant by age , Or thou wert born a fool .
A pair of tribunes that have rack 'd for Rome , To make coals cheap , -- a noble memory !
CORIOLANUS : Have you inform 'd them sithence ?
But I , that am not shaped for sportive tricks , Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass ; I , that am rudely stamp 'd , and want love 's majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph ; I , that am curtail 'd of this fair proportion , Cheated of feature by dissembling nature , Deformed , unfinish 'd , sent before my time Into this breathing world , scarce half made up , And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them ; Why , I , in this weak piping time of peace , Have no delight to pass away the time , Unless to spy my shadow in the sun And descant on mine own deformity : And therefore , since I can not prove a lover , To entertain these fair well-spoken days , I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days .
But leave it all to God .
GLOUCESTER : How ?
for all your friends are fled , And Warwick rages like a chafed bull : Away !
ISABELLA : In such a one as , you consenting to't , Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear , And leave you naked .
AEdile : I have .
This dagger hath mista'en -- for , lo , his house Is empty on the back of Montague , -- And it mis-sheathed in my daughter 's bosom !
BALTHASAR : I dare not , sir My master knows not but I am gone hence ; And fearfully did menace me with death , If I did stay to look on his intents .
Lord Angelo , having affairs to heaven , Intends you for his swift ambassador , Where you shall be an everlasting leiger : Therefore your best appointment make with speed ; To-morrow you set on .
What 's worse than murderer , that I may name it ?
FLORIZEL : I have : but what of him ?
Why , it contains no king ?
O royal piece , There 's magic in thy majesty , which has My evils conjured to remembrance and From thy admiring daughter took the spirits , Standing like stone with thee .
A fine spot , in good faith .
stand thou , when I command : Advance thy halbert higher than my breast , Or , by Saint Paul , I 'll strike thee to my foot , And spurn upon thee , beggar , for thy boldness .
AUTOLYCUS : Adieu , sir .
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn .
Nurse : Tybalt is gone , and Romeo banished ; Romeo that kill 'd him , he is banished .
Brother , farewell : I will unto the king ; And whatsoever you will employ me in , Were it to call King Edward 's widow sister , I will perform it to enfranchise you .
I must to the learned.
Look , therefore , Lewis , that by this league and marriage Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour ; For though usurpers sway the rule awhile , Yet heavens are just , and time suppresseth wrongs .
Thus , like the formal vice , Iniquity , I moralize two meanings in one word .
KING EDWARD IV : Then be it as you will ; for 't is my right , And Henry but usurps the diadem .
First Citizen : Your belly 's answer ?
Now mark me , how I will undo myself ; I give this heavy weight from off my head And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand , The pride of kingly sway from out my heart ; With mine own tears I wash away my balm , With mine own hands I give away my crown , With mine own tongue deny my sacred state , With mine own breath release all duty 's rites : All pomp and majesty I do forswear ; My manors , rents , revenues I forego ; My acts , decrees , and statutes I deny : God pardon all oaths that are broke to me !
If thou refuse And wilt encounter with my wrath , say so ; The bastard brains with these my proper hands Shall I dash out .
Master lieutenant , pray you , by your leave , How doth the prince , and my young son of York ?
PAULINA : I say she 's dead ; I 'll swear't .
CORIOLANUS : Marcius !
Nurse : Nay , he 's a flower ; in faith , a very flower .
KING RICHARD III : Now , by my George , my garter , and my crown , -- QUEEN ELIZABETH : Profaned , dishonour 'd , and the third usurp 'd .
Is my father well ?
what will he ?
Shepherd : I know not , a n't like you .
FLORIZEL : Come , come , he must not .
All : No more talking o n't ; let it be done : away , away !
Heaven shield my mother play 'd my father fair !
I pray you , sir , what saucy merchant was this , that was so full of his ropery ?
MAMILLIUS : No , I 'll none of you .
MARCIUS : Let him alone ; He did inform the truth : but for our gentlemen , The common file -- a plague !
Farewell .
JULIET : Ay , those attires are best : but , gentle nurse , I pray thee , leave me to myself to-night , For I have need of many orisons To move the heavens to smile upon my state , Which , well thou know'st , is cross , and full of sin .
JULIET : Come hither , nurse .
BAGOT : If judgement lie in them , then so do we , Because we ever have been near the king .
Our aediles smote ?
He was not so resolved when last we spake together .
FRANCISCA : It is a man 's voice .
AUFIDIUS : Say , what 's thy name ?
SICINIUS : This is most likely !
CAMILLO : I dare not know , my lord .
CORIOLANUS : O the gods !
This you may know And so deliver , I am put to sea With her whom here I can not hold on shore ; And most opportune to our need I have A vessel rides fast by , but not prepared For this design .
QUEEN MARGARET : And lessen 'd be that small , God , I beseech thee !
Did York 's dread curse prevail so much with heaven ?
HERMIONE : Nay , but you will ?
But O , the noble combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina !
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded .
Was this face the face That every day under his household roof Did keep ten thousand men ?
He 's simple and tells much .
Bootless are plaints , and cureless are my wounds ; No way to fly , nor strength to hold out flight : The foe is merciless , and will not pity ; For at their hands I have deserved no pity .
for any good That I myself have done unto myself ?
Shepherd : My business , sir , is to the king .
CATESBY : Here , my lord .
that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet ; So Romeo would , were he not Romeo call 'd , Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title .
Edward and Richard , you shall stay with me ; My brother Montague shall post to London : Let noble Warwick , Cobham , and the rest , Whom we have left protectors of the king , With powerful policy strengthen themselves , And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths .
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead -- Strange dream , that gives a dead man leave to think !
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece ?
Clown : His vices , you would say ; there 's no virtue whipped out of the court : they cherish it to make it stay there ; and yet it will no more but abide .
Come , therefore , let 's about it speedily .
I beseech you , Grant me this boon .
that we can not mend ; They break their faith to God as well as us : Cry woe , destruction , ruin and decay : The worst is death , and death will have his day .
KING RICHARD II : Farewell , my lord : securely I espy Virtue with valour couched in thine eye .
SICINIUS : Well , here he comes .
the cords That Romeo bid thee fetch ?
If I do send , dispatch Those centuries to our aid : the rest will serve For a short holding : if we lose the field , We can not keep the town .
DUKE VINCENTIO : Then was your sin of heavier kind than his .
Would I were dead , but that , methinks , already -- What was he that did make it ?
The lining of his coffers shall make coats To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars .
DUKE VINCENTIO : There rest .
THOMAS MOWBRAY : Myself I throw , dread sovereign , at thy foot .
COMINIUS : It is your former promise .
VOLUMNIA : More noble blows than ever thou wise words ; And for Rome 's good .
A Patrician : You do the nobler .
Where'er I wander , boast of this I can , Though banish 'd , yet a trueborn Englishman .
AEdile : The people 's enemy is gone , is gone !
VOLUMNIA : I know not where to turn : O , welcome home : And welcome , general : and ye 're welcome all .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
Was not a man my father ?
POLIXENES : That 's likewise part of my intelligence ; but , I fear , the angle that plucks our son thither .
The nobles they are fled , the commons they are cold , And will , I fear , revolt on Hereford 's side .
DUCHESS OF YORK : O happy vantage of a kneeling knee !
Happy star , reign now !
KING RICHARD III : He said the truth : and what said Surrey then ?
I am courtier cap-a-pe ; and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there : whereupon I command thee to open thy affair .
Look , when he fawns , he bites ; and when he bites , His venom tooth will rankle to the death : Have not to do with him , beware of him ; Sin , death , and hell have set their marks on him , And all their ministers attend on him .
ANGELO : How now , sir !
ELBOW : Marry , I thank your good worship for it .
And now what rests but that we spend the time With stately triumphs , mirthful comic shows , Such as befits the pleasure of the court ?
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : My gracious uncle , let me know my fault : On what condition stands it and wherein ?
CAMILLO : I think , this coming summer , the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him .
YORK : Open Thy gate of mercy , gracious God !
where be thy brothers ?
MENENIUS : Nay , but , fellow , fellow , -- CORIOLANUS : What 's the matter ?
or those doves ' eyes , Which can make gods forsworn ?
KING EDWARD IV : You cavil , widow : I did mean , my queen .
I would the fool were married to her grave !
EDWARD : Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave ?
RICHARD : Ay , now methinks I hear great Warwick speak : Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day , That cries 'Retire , ' if Warwick bid him stay .
CLARENCE : And there 's for twitting me with perjury .
MENENIUS : BRUTUS : Sir , those cold ways , That seem like prudent helps , are very poisonous Where the disease is violent .
VOLUMNIA : Your knee , sirrah .
Now , this no more dishonours you at all Than to take in a town with gentle words , Which else would put you to your fortune and The hazard of much blood .
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car , And made an evening at the noontide prick .
-- here on his manly breast : A piteous corse , a bloody piteous corse ; Pale , pale as ashes , all bedaub 'd in blood , All in gore-blood ; I swounded at the sight .
Beat thou the drum , that it speak mournfully : Trail your steel pikes .
Dogs , easily won to fawn on any man !
I hear his drum : be copious in exclaims .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : O , thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider , that foul bunch-back 'd toad !
AUTOLYCUS : Indeed , I have had earnest : but I can not with conscience take it .
HASTINGS : To Lynn , my lord , And ship from thence to Flanders .
What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge ?
How now !
Yet am I sick for fear : speak it again ; Twice saying 'pardon ' doth not pardon twain , But makes one pardon strong .
Yet lives our pilot still .
Say , Scroop , where lies our uncle with his power ?
Second Servingman : Where 's Cotus ?
KING EDWARD IV : Belike she minds to play the Amazon .
First Gentleman : Who would be thence that has the benefit of access ?
Your knees to me ?
Therefore , beseech you , -- You that will be less fearful than discreet , That love the fundamental part of state More than you doubt the change o n't , that prefer A noble life before a long , and wish To jump a body with a dangerous physic That 's sure of death without it , at once pluck out The multitudinous tongue ; let them not lick The sweet which is their poison : your dishonour Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state Of that integrity which should become't , Not having the power to do the good it would , For the in which doth control't .
An old sheep-whistling rogue a ram-tender , to offer to have his daughter come into grace !
MARCIUS : Then shall we hear their 'larum , and they ours .
Therefore , go back .
BUSHY : Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows , Which shows like grief itself , but is not so ; For sorrow 's eye , glazed with blinding tears , Divides one thing entire to many objects ; Like perspectives , which rightly gazed upon Show nothing but confusion , eyed awry Distinguish form : so your sweet majesty , Looking awry upon your lord 's departure , Find shapes of grief , more than himself , to wail ; Which , look 'd on as it is , is nought but shadows Of what it is not .
HASTINGS : 'T is like enough , for I stay dinner there .
YORK : That face of his the hungry cannibals Would not have touch 'd , would not have stain 'd with blood : But you are more inhuman , more inexorable , O , ten times more , than tigers of Hyrcania .
Not speak ?
CAMILLO : He would not stay at your petitions : made His business more material .
More than I have said , loving countrymen , The leisure and enforcement of the time Forbids to dwell upon : yet remember this , God and our good cause fight upon our side ; The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls , Like high-rear 'd bulwarks , stand before our faces ; Richard except , those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow : For what is he they follow ?
RUTLAND : I never did thee harm : why wilt thou slay me ?
MENENIUS : I 'll bring him to you .
Fear you the boar , and go so unprovided ?
Mercutio 's kinsman , noble County Paris !
They say poor suitors have strong breaths : they shall know we have strong arms too .
WARWICK : Poor Clifford !
A brittle glory shineth in this face : As brittle as the glory is the face ; For there it is , crack 'd in a hundred shivers .
KING HENRY VI : Well-minded Clarence , be thou fortunate !
I will bite my thumb at them ; which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air ?
POLIXENES : She embraces him .
Make me not sighted like the basilisk : I have look 'd on thousands , who have sped the better By my regard , but kill 'd none so .
Messenger : Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret , With them Sir Thomas Vaughan , prisoners .
QUEEN MARGARET : Bear with me ; I am hungry for revenge , And now I cloy me with beholding it .
-- Were of an age : well , Susan is with God ; She was too good for me : but , as I said , On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen ; That shall she , marry ; I remember it well .
KING RICHARD II : Old John of Gaunt , time-honour 'd Lancaster , Hast thou , according to thy oath and band , Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son , Here to make good the boisterous late appeal , Which then our leisure would not let us hear , Against the Duke of Norfolk , Thomas Mowbray ?
SICINIUS : Meet on the market-place .
How long have you been in this place of constable ?
To him will I present them : there may be matter in it .
MENENIUS : This but done , Even as she speaks , why , their hearts were yours ; For they have pardons , being ask 'd , as free As words to little purpose .
ROMEO : O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
MENENIUS : O , he 's a limb that has but a disease ; Mortal , to cut it off ; to cure it , easy .
How shall this bisson multitude digest The senate 's courtesy ?
He 's not prepared for death .
HERMIONE : He 'll stay my lord .
That I was nothing .
Will't please you , sir , be gone ?
PRINCE EDWARD : Good lords , make all the speedy haste you may .
Citizens : No , no , no , no , no .
Do not repent these things , for they are heavier Than all thy woes can stir ; therefore betake thee To nothing but despair .
A thousand welcomes !
When last I was at Exeter , The mayor in courtesy show 'd me the castle , And call 'd it Rougemont : at which name I started , Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond .
I shall be loved when I am lack 'd .
CLAUDIO : I humbly thank you .
Come .
LORD WILLOUGHBY : And daily new exactions are devised , As blanks , benevolences , and I wot not what : But what , o ' God 's name , doth become of this ?
What !
LADY ANNE : I have already .
Go to Lord Angelo , And let him learn to know , when maidens sue , Men give like gods ; but when they weep and kneel , All their petitions are as freely theirs As they themselves would owe them .
KING RICHARD II : Discomfortable cousin !
POMPEY : I thank your worship for your good counsel : but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine .
Thy best of rest is sleep , And that thou oft provokest ; yet grossly fear'st Thy death , which is no more .
I have your alms : adieu .
But the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i ' the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday ; for the other has half , by the entreaty and grant of the whole table .
methinks it were a happy life , To be no better than a homely swain ; To sit upon a hill , as I do now , To carve out dials quaintly , point by point , Thereby to see the minutes how they run , How many make the hour full complete ; How many hours bring about the day ; How many days will finish up the year ; How many years a mortal man may live .
LUCIO : ANGELO : Your brother is a forfeit of the law , And you but waste your words .
LUCIO : A hundred , if they 'll do you any good .
I love a ballad but even too well , if it be doleful matter merrily set down , or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably .
The earth that 's nature 's mother is her tomb ; What is her burying grave that is her womb , And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find , Many for many virtues excellent , None but for some and yet all different .
BISHOP OF CARLISLE : Marry .
KING RICHARD III : I cry thee mercy : There is my purse to cure that blow of thine .
Anon , good nurse !
Go , fellow , get thee home , provide some carts And bring away the armour that is there .
let 's see : 'T is very true , my grief lies all within ; And these external manners of laments Are merely shadows to the unseen grief That swells with silence in the tortured soul ; There lies the substance : and I thank thee , king , For thy great bounty , that not only givest Me cause to wail but teachest me the way How to lament the cause .
Had I been there , which am a silly woman , The soldiers should have toss 'd me on their pikes Before I would have granted to that act .
DORSET : Dispute not with her ; she is lunatic .
Give me a case to put my visage in : A visor for a visor !
Where slept our scouts , or how are they seduced , That we could hear no news of his repair ?
Would I were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest !
MENENIUS : Fie , fie , fie !
Second Senator : Noble Aufidius , Take your commission ; hie you to your bands : Let us alone to guard Corioli : If they set down before 's , for the remove Bring your army ; but , I think , you 'll find They 've not prepared for us .
WARWICK : I had rather chop this hand off at a blow , And with the other fling it at thy face , Than bear so low a sail , to strike to thee .
MISTRESS OVERDONE : What , is there a maid with child by him ?
Daughter , speak you : He cares not for your weeping .
is it ended , then ?
The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity , stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels : if I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal , I would not do't : I hold it the more knavery to conceal it ; and therein am I constant to my profession .
It is not yet near day .
LEONTES : What is the business ?
QUEEN MARGARET : What , dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel ?
CAPULET : Well get you gone : o ' Thursday be it , then .
Thou old and true Menenius , Thy tears are salter than a younger man 's , And venomous to thine eyes .
EARL OF SALISBURY : Stay yet another day , thou trusty Welshman : The king reposeth all his confidence in thee .
Nurse : O woe !
GREGORY : No , marry ; I fear thee !
Did Julius Caesar build that place , my lord ?
Did I put Henry from his native right ?

But , come on , Contract us 'fore these witnesses .
SICINIUS : Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius ?
Still , methinks , There is an air comes from her : what fine chisel Could ever yet cut breath ?
BENVOLIO : The date is out of such prolixity : We 'll have no Cupid hoodwink 'd with a scarf , Bearing a Tartar 's painted bow of lath , Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper ; Nor no without-book prologue , faintly spoke After the prompter , for our entrance : But let them measure us by what they will ; We 'll measure them a measure , and be gone .
This Volumnia Is worth of consuls , senators , patricians , A city full ; of tribunes , such as you , A sea and land full .
First Murderer : Tush !
GLOUCESTER : Lady , you know no rules of charity , Which renders good for bad , blessings for curses .
Pardon me , lords , 't is the first time that ever I was forced to scold .
Make war upon themselves ; blood against blood , Self against self : O , preposterous And frantic outrage , end thy damned spleen ; Or let me die , to look on death no more !
Now , by mine honour , by my life , by my troth , I will appeach the villain .

ROMEO : Father , what news ?
thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond : I will not trust you , sir .
If thou wouldst , There shouldst thou find one heinous article , Containing the deposing of a king And cracking the strong warrant of an oath , Mark 'd with a blot , damn 'd in the book of heaven : Nay , all of you that stand and look upon , Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself , Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands Showing an outward pity ; yet you Pilates Have here deliver 'd me to my sour cross , And water can not wash away your sin .
CLEOMENES : All this we swear .
First Lady : Come , my gracious lord , Shall I be your playfellow ?
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : I know it , uncle , and oppose not myself Against their will .
What should the people do with these bald tribunes ?
SICINIUS : Not ?
My dangerous cousin , let your mother in : I know she is come to pray for your foul sin .
BRUTUS : Lay A fault on us , your tribunes ; that we laboured , No impediment between , but that you must Cast your election on him .
What then ?

Boy : Good aunt , you wept not for our father 's death ; How can we aid you with our kindred tears ?
They are come .
CORIOLANUS : I do beseech you , Let me o'erleap that custom , for I can not Put on the gown , stand naked and entreat them , For my wounds ' sake , to give their suffrage : please you That I may pass this doing .
Death is my son-in-law , Death is my heir ; My daughter he hath wedded : I will die , And leave him all ; life , living , all is Death 's .
I had a brother , then .
LEONTES : O Paulina , We honour you with trouble : but we came To see the statue of our queen : your gallery Have we pass 'd through , not without much content In many singularities ; but we saw not That which my daughter came to look upon , The statue of her mother .
Boy : Think you my uncle did dissemble , grandam ?
LADY GREY : The fruits of love I mean , my loving liege .
Which of you trembles not that looks on me ?
CORIOLANUS : May I change these garments ?
Prodigious birth of love it is to me , That I must love a loathed enemy .
LADY CAPULET : Hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , nurse .
Second Citizen : An 'twere to give again , -- but 't is no matter .
JULIET : Well , thou hast comforted me marvellous much .
The silent hours steal on , And flaky darkness breaks within the east .
Fear and be slain ; no worse can come to fight : And fight and die is death destroying death ; Where fearing dying pays death servile breath .
MENENIUS : No , in such a case the gods will not be good unto us .
LADY CAPULET : Here comes your father ; tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands .
There 's not a soldier of us all , that , in the thanksgiving before meat , do relish the petition well that prays for peace .
Messenger : Such news , my lord , as grieves me to unfold .
and well met , gentlemen : I hope the king is not yet shipp 'd for Ireland .
my lord !
CATESBY : Call them again , my lord , and accept their suit .
Not his that spoils her young before her face .
First Soldier : Will not you go ?
BRAKENBURY : No , madam , no ; I may not leave it so : I am bound by oath , and therefore pardon me .
what , dost thou make us minstrels ?
WARWICK : Why then it sorts , brave warriors , let 's away .
KING RICHARD II : Too well , too well thou tell'st a tale so ill. Where is the Earl of Wiltshire ?
GLOUCESTER : My dagger , little cousin ?
The man is noble and his fame folds-in This orb o ' the earth .
where is my lord ?
So , here comes a brace .
And thus I prophesy , that many a thousand , Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear , And many an old man 's sigh and many a widow 's , And many an orphan 's water-standing eye -- Men for their sons , wives for their husbands , And orphans for their parents timeless death -- Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born .
Commend me to thy brother , Edmund York .
The children live , whose parents thou hast slaughter 'd , Ungovern 'd youth , to wail it in their age ; The parents live , whose children thou hast butcher 'd , Old wither 'd plants , to wail it with their age .
3 KING HENRY VI KING EDWARD IV : So , lie thou there : die thou , and die our fear ; For Warwick was a bug that fear 'd us all .

I pray you , come .
EXTON : 'Have I no friend ? '
JULIET : O God , I have an ill-divining soul !
Affrighted much , I did in time collect myself and thought This was so and no slumber .
Ah , tutor , look where bloody Clifford comes !
Thou !
God-den to your worships : more of your conversation would infect my brain , being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians : I will be bold to take my leave of you .
O earth , which this blood drink'st revenge his death !
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear , Although apparent guilt be seen in them ; And shall the figure of God 's majesty , His captain , steward , deputy-elect , Anointed , crowned , planted many years , Be judged by subject and inferior breath , And he himself not present ?
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Kind sister , thanks : we 'll enter all together .
I 'll know His pleasure ; may be he will relent .
The shadow of my sorrow !
I got them in my country 's service , when Some certain of your brethren roar 'd and ran From the noise of our own drums . '
All Conspirators : Kill , kill , kill , kill , kill him !
Darest thou die ?
WARWICK : From worthy Edward , King of Albion , My lord and sovereign , and thy vowed friend , I come , in kindness and unfeigned love , First , to do greetings to thy royal person ; And then to crave a league of amity ; And lastly , to confirm that amity With a nuptial knot , if thou vouchsafe to grant That virtuous Lady Bona , thy fair sister , To England 's king in lawful marriage .
O woful sympathy !
JULIET : What satisfaction canst thou have to-night ?
KING LEWIS XI : Now , sister , let us hear your firm resolve .

LADY ANNE : O wonderful , when devils tell the truth !
what manners is in this ?
FROTH : Here in Vienna , sir .
To have him suddenly convey 'd away .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Stand all apart , And show fair duty to his majesty .
SICINIUS : One thus descended , That hath beside well in his person wrought To be set high in place , we did commend To your remembrances : but you have found , Scaling his present bearing with his past , That he 's your fixed enemy , and revoke Your sudden approbation .
KING LEWIS XI : But is he gracious in the people 's eye ?
who comes here ?
FLORIZEL : See , your guests approach : Address yourself to entertain them sprightly , And let 's be red with mirth .
AUTOLYCUS : Shepherd : To the palace , an it like your worship .
What !
And madly play with my forefather 's joints ?
Answer no more , for thou shalt be my queen .
SICINIUS : Bid them home : Say their great enemy is gone , and they Stand in their ancient strength .
but come what sorrow can , It can not countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight : Do thou but close our hands with holy words , Then love-devouring death do what he dare ; It is enough I may but call her mine .
for what purpose , love ?
His royal person , -- Whom God preserve better than you would wish !
The game was ne'er so fair , and I am done .
what flaying ?
madman !
Messenger : Ah , one that was a woful looker-on When as the noble Duke of York was slain , Your princely father and my loving lord !
both with an R. Nurse : Ah .
the fatal followers do pursue ; And I am faint and can not fly their fury : And were I strong , I would not shun their fury : The sands are number 'd that make up my life ; Here must I stay , and here my life must end .
God forbid !
Let 't alone .
QUEEN MARGARET : A little joy enjoys the queen thereof ; For I am she , and altogether joyless .
Tell me , thou villain slave , where are my children ?
O bloody times !
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet : Said he not so ?
GLOUCESTER : I go ; and if you plead as well for them As I can say nay to thee for myself , No doubt well bring it to a happy issue .
He -- to give fear to use and liberty , Which have for long run by the hideous law , As mice by lions -- hath pick 'd out an act , Under whose heavy sense your brother 's life Falls into forfeit : he arrests him on it ; And follows close the rigour of the statute , To make him an example .
MERCUTIO : That dreamers often lie .
Bids't thou me rage ?
LEONTES : Would he do so , I'ld beg your precious mistress , Which he counts but a trifle .
All : We know't , we know't .
The measure done , I 'll watch her place of stand , And , touching hers , make blessed my rude hand .
Down with the Capulets !
I , as I may -- that which I would I can not , -- With best advantage will deceive the time , And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms : But on thy side I may not be too forward Lest , being seen , thy brother , tender George , Be executed in his father 's sight .
What love , think'st thou , I sue so much to get ?
Justice : Eleven , sir .
MERCUTIO : A sail , a sail !
OXFORD : Here pitch our battle ; hence we will not budge .
KING EDWARD IV : Alas , poor Clarence !
But as this title honours me and mine , So your dislike , to whom I would be pleasing , Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow .
RICHMOND : Why , then 't is time to arm and give direction .
Clown : I would you did but see how it chafes , how it rages , how it takes up the shore !
CAMILLO : You pay a great deal too dear for what 's given freely .
Lovel and Ratcliff , look that it be done : The rest , that love me , rise and follow me .
MENENIUS : 'T is Aufidius , Who , hearing of our Marcius ' banishment , Thrusts forth his horns again into the world ; Which were inshell 'd when Marcius stood for Rome , And durst not once peep out .
SAMPSON : I strike quickly , being moved .
a prize !
BENVOLIO : Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
Second Senator : Howsoever you have been his liar , as you say you have , I am one that , telling true under him , must say , you can not pass .
If it be so , out with it boldly , man ; Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .
Most mighty liege , and my companion peers , Take from my mouth the wish of happy years : As gentle and as jocund as to jest Go I to fight : truth hath a quiet breast .
KING RICHARD III : My father 's death -- QUEEN ELIZABETH : Thy life hath that dishonour 'd .
DUCHESS OF YORK : No , boy .
Five times , Marcius , I have fought with thee : so often hast thou beat me , And wouldst do so , I think , should we encounter As often as we eat .
CORIOLANUS : Have I had children 's voices ?
Myself , a prince by fortune of my birth , Near to the king in blood , and near in love Till you did make him misinterpret me , Have stoop 'd my neck under your injuries , And sigh 'd my English breath in foreign clouds , Eating the bitter bread of banishment ; Whilst you have fed upon my signories , Dispark 'd my parks and fell 'd my forest woods , From my own windows torn my household coat , Razed out my imprese , leaving me no sign , Save men 's opinions and my living blood , To show the world I am a gentleman .
When at Bohemia You take my lord , I 'll give him my commission To let him there a month behind the gest Prefix 'd for 's parting : yet , good deed , Leontes , I love thee not a jar o ' the clock behind What lady-she her lord .
no .
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field Should not be able to encounter mine .
